# NETS ERP Performance Review Implementation Progress Tracker

This tracker monitors the status of each page screen and the corresponding backend services (Prisma schema models, routing, API CRUD handlers, and seeding scripts) required to support it.

## Live Database Fetch Checklist

All pages utilizing the ERP Store are now fully integrated with dynamic backend fetches and updates. Below is the verification checklist:

- [x] **Login & Landing Page (`/`)** - Dynamically fetches and matches user directory data from database endpoint `/users`.
- [x] **Employee Dashboard (`/employee`)** - Dynamically fetches active review and timeline details from `/reviews?employeeId=...`.
- [x] **My Performance Reviews (`/employee/reviews`)** - Dynamically fetches active performance review cycles from `/cycles`.
- [x] **Performance Review Form (`/employee/reviews/[id]`)** - Dynamically loads evaluation details, populates categorized objectives, and submits evaluations to `/reviews` (`POST`/`PUT`).
- [x] **Employee Profile (`/employee/profile`)** - Fetches personal user metrics and details dynamically from `/users?id=...`.
- [x] **Line Manager Dashboard (`/manager`)** - Fetches list of reviews and user directories dynamically from `/reviews` and `/users`.
- [x] **Manager Review Screen (`/manager/review/[employeeId]`)** - Loads employee answers, self-scores, and competency categories, and updates manager scores and feedback to `/reviews` (`PUT`).
- [x] **HR Dashboard (`/hr`)** - Dynamically fetches reviews progress, department averages, and completion stats from `/reviews`.
- [x] **HR Review Screen (`/hr/review/[employeeId]`)** - Dynamically audits evaluations and writes sign-offs or returns review forms to `/reviews`.
- [x] **Review Cycle Management (`/hr/cycle`)** - Creates, updates status, and publishes active cycle timelines to `/cycles`.
- [x] **Objective Management (`/hr/objectives`)** - Performs dynamic CRUD actions on performance items (added/updated items synced to `/objectives` via `POST`, and deleted items synced via `DELETE`).
- [x] **User & Role Management (`/hr/users`)** - Fetches and manages global user list directory dynamically from `/users`.
- [x] **MD Dashboard (`/md`)** - Fetches overall stats and computes company-wide department comparison charts dynamically using live `/reviews` and `/users` data.
- [x] **Department Performance (`/md/department/[deptId]`)** - Dynamically queries department-specific performance scores from `/reviews`.
